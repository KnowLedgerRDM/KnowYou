# KnowYou
This **KnowLedger** repository is where we want to get your thoughts on what **you** need to support your research 
project from a data management perspective. No matter what of research you do, whether you are from the physical sciences
or the social sciences, managing your data is a major component of what you do so, how can we make it better?

Tell us what your utopian research notebook/tool/system would look like in terms of functionality, content, 
design, security, access etc.  This could be from many different perspectives:
- displaying tables, graphs, video
- running code in the terminal, as a notebook (e.g. Python/Juptyer), or 
- take photos or video, or record audio
- manage jobs on a high performance computer (HPC) cluster
- using AI to scan/analyze text in surveys or summarize the findings from set of experiments
- import data from domain repositories, research instruments, or API accessible databases

Provide your thoughts by submitting a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/KnowLedgerProject/KnowYou/issues) using one of the templates provided.  Your feedback will then
be made available to the communities working in focused areas of this project, each one coordinated via a GitHub repository.

Later on, once the project is going, we will enable discussions in this repo to encourage discussion of your ideas.

Cheers, The KnowLedger Team
